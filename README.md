Device Analytics Platform
=========================

This application tracks device information to perform analytics.

I am highly interested in distributed computing and data science. Mobile devices are a goldmine to analyze certain behavior patterns which can help us answer problems.

This is still in development. Right now I want to build and connect all these services. After, I will dockerize and push it to the cloud :)

The project is setup using:

- [Spring Cloud](https://start.spring.io/)
- [Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka)
- [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/)
- [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
